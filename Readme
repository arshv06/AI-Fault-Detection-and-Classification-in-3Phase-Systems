This project aims to develop robust AI algorithms using various
AI trainers offered by MATLAB. Scaled Conjugate Gradient, is
utilized as the best option to train and test our ANN on a
testing data set. The ANN learns from the training dataset and
utilizes learning patterns to detect and classify faults by
identifying abnormal voltage and current deviations from
balanced conditions.
The training dataset comprises all possible permutations of
injectable faults in a three-phase power system (eleven in
total).

A MATLAB Simulink model is designed to create our
testing and training datasets. It features two three-phase
power sources: one to supply the voltage and another with a -
30degree offset to simulate a load. The transmission lines are
connected to 11 fault injectors with each one consecutively
injecting a 0.003s long fault at an interval of 0.10s. The scope
records the Voltage and Current data values for every line
which is then exported into a spreadsheet format. This file is
fed into our MATLAB code to develop and train the AI model.
The discrete sample time was set at 0.003s to keep the
recorded data points under 5,000 to maximize efficiency and
minimize overlapping.

Unexpected failures in electrical power transmission lines,
such as short circuits, can lead to severe economic losses
and reduce system reliability. Quick identification and
categorization of these faults are essential for safety.
Traditional methods rely on human feature extraction and
prior knowledge. This project develops a three-phase
simulation model with fault injectors to create datasets for
training and testing AI algorithms, aiming to improve fault
detection and classification. Artificial Neural
networks (ANNs) will be employed to analyze and classify
fault data with high accuracy
